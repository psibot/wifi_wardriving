# wifi_wardriving

Some fun toys , works well on ubuntu and kali 32 bit - (reaver needs it). Scripts to automate and install wardriving software. You will need to configure drivers for cards.

THIS IS FOR FUN!!! - Wifi and wardriving takes time and effort. Its not a quick fix... enjoy.

WAR_deamon.sh - will sync and build some of the tools you need to wardrive... I am playing around with the script - Works on great on KALI 32 bit.

Run attacks as sudo or root !!!
